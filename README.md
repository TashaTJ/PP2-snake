# **Snake - Project Portfolio 2 - Javascript**

Snake is an interactive online homage to the infamous 1998 Nokia mobile game. Snake has roots in the 1976 arcade classic, Blockade. Since then, there have been hundreds of versions released, and for good reason. It is considered a classic in terms of design and even appears in New York's Museum of Modern Art alongside the likes of Minecraft, Pong and Tetris.
